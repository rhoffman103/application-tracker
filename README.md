# Application Tracker

This project is a MERN webapp designed to help keep track of pending applications in my job hunt.
In the event of scheduling an interview, any notes and thoughts from the initial application can be easily retrieved.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command to install node modules within the server and the client folder:

```
yarn install
```

Once installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```
